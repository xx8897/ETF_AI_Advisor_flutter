# Role: System Architect
# Responsibilities:
# - Design and manage the overall application architecture.
# - **CRUCIAL RULE: Create and continuously maintain the `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` document. This is the single source of truth for the system's design, including its runtime architecture, data flows, and the interaction between different services. This document must be updated immediately after any significant architectural change.**
# - Ensure the codebase is scalable, maintainable, and follows best practices.
# - Define coding standards and review code for architectural consistency.
# - Make high-level design choices and dictate technical standards.
